## About Me

I'm *Aryasen Gupta*

⚒️ Civil Engineer | 💡 Problem Solver | 🚀 Innovator



Hailing from Allahabad, India, I have always been captivated by the profound principles of mechanics and their practical applications in our daily lives.

My journey in the pursuit of knowledge and excellence has brought me to the esteemed *Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi* with a legacy dating back before India's independence, has provided me with an exceptional platform to nurture my dreams and aspirations., where I am currently a third-year student majoring in Civil Engineering.

### Development of driving cycle and estimation of associated emmissions

A Project under Associate Professor Dr. Abhishek Mudgal

*📅 Duration:*  Jan ’23-May ’23

*🔧 Description:*

-Advanced Programming for Data Analysis: Leveraged Python with Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, and Glob to analyze real-world driving cycle data, calculating vital parameters such as average speed, acceleration, idling, and cruising.

-Micro-Trip Integration: Strategically derived micro-trips from speed-time profiles and seamlessly integrated them to construct a comprehensive driving cycle.

-Comparative Benchmarking: Benchmarked Varanasi's driving cycle against IDC and EUDC, uncovering a notable 5.11% speed increase from IDC and a stark 101.99% decrease from EUDC, directing pivotal vehicle performance optimizations.

-Emission Impact Analysis: Employed the city's developed driving cycle to assess crucial pollutants (CO, NOx, CO2), shedding light on the potential environmental ramifications within urban settings.

-Emission Data Generation: Through precision parameter matching and specialized modeling, derived emission data to understand the broader environmental impact of real-world driving cycles.

This endeavour seamlessly merged theoretical insights with practical application, exemplifying my commitment to pushing the boundaries of engineering knowledge.

### Team Averera 


*📅 Duration:* Nov'22 - July'23


*📟 Description:* 

-Integrated User Interface: I designed a GUI using Python, effectively displaying real-time vehicular data on an LCD connected to a Raspberry Pi, enhancing the driver's interaction and understanding of their vehicle's performance.

-Seamless Data Collection & Transmission: Leveraging sensors for raw data capture, the system employs an Arduino for data manipulation, ensuring accurate and efficient I2C communication with the Raspberry Pi for real-time updates.

-Optimized Driving Strategy: By presenting essential metrics such as RPM and electric current flow, drivers are equipped with the information they need to adapt their driving patterns, ultimately boosting vehicular efficiency and road safety.
