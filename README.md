### Development of driving cycle and estimation of associated emmissions

A Project under Associate Professor Dr. Abhishek Mudgal

*📅 Duration:*  Jan ’23-May ’23

*🔧 Description:*

-Advanced Programming for Data Analysis: Leveraged Python with Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, and Glob to analyze real-world driving cycle data, calculating vital parameters such as average speed, acceleration, idling, and cruising.

-Micro-Trip Integration: Strategically derived micro-trips from speed-time profiles and seamlessly integrated them to construct a comprehensive driving cycle.

-Comparative Benchmarking: Benchmarked Varanasi's driving cycle against IDC and EUDC, uncovering a notable 5.11% speed increase from IDC and a stark 101.99% decrease from EUDC, directing pivotal vehicle performance optimizations.

-Emission Impact Analysis: Employed the city's developed driving cycle to assess crucial pollutants (CO, NOx, CO2), shedding light on the potential environmental ramifications within urban settings.

-Emission Data Generation: Through precision parameter matching and specialized modeling, derived emission data to understand the broader environmental impact of real-world driving cycles.

This endeavour seamlessly merged theoretical insights with practical application, exemplifying my commitment to pushing the boundaries of engineering knowledge.

### Team Averera 


*📅 Duration:* Nov'22 - July'23


*📟 Description:* 

Integrated User Interface: I designed a GUI using Python, effectively displaying real-time vehicular data on an LCD connected to a Raspberry Pi, enhancing the driver's interaction and understanding of their vehicle's performance.

Seamless Data Collection & Transmission: Leveraging sensors for raw data capture, the system employs an Arduino for data manipulation, ensuring accurate and efficient I2C communication with the Raspberry Pi for real-time updates.

Optimized Driving Strategy: By presenting essential metrics such as RPM and electric current flow, drivers are equipped with the information they need to adapt their driving patterns, ultimately boosting vehicular efficiency and road safety.

# About Me

Hello there! I'm Anshuman Chaurasia, a determined and ambitious individual hailing from a middle-class background. My journey in pursuit of knowledge and excellence has led me to the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, where I am currently a sophomore in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. With its rich history predating India's independence, this institution has been the perfect platform for me to nurture my dreams and aspirations.

From the very beginning of my college life, I have harbored a passion for aerospace engineering. To achieve my goals, I actively participated in various activities that challenged and broadened my understanding of mechanical engineering. One of the highlights was my involvement in the team dedicated to building a Formula Student car—a project that not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork and perseverance.

Another unforgettable experience was being part of a team that dared to take flight in the prestigious Boeing Aeromodelling Challenge at IIT Kanpur. This venture was a true test of my courage to face the unknown and venture into uncharted territories. I embraced these challenges fearlessly, always hungry for knowledge and eager to learn from every situation.

My foray into the world of robotics began with the Inter IIT competition, where I delved into the complexities of robotic systems. This exposure, coupled with my participation in the JLR's Robotic Arm Challenge, opened up a whole new realm of possibilities and sparked my curiosity to explore further.

Seeking to deepen my understanding of robotics, I embarked on a research internship at STOCH LAB under The Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems (RBCCPS), IISC, Bangalore. During this immersive experience, I dived into the intricacies of actuators, gears, and transmission in quadruped bots. The slow-paced yet enriching internship allowed me to explore real-world applications and delve into the forefront of cutting-edge technology.

Moreover, I had the privilege of contributing to the development of a hydrokinetic turbine, a revolutionary product that generates electricity from flowing water without the need for dams. This endeavour exposed me to the fascinating realm of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). I had previously worked on CFD simulations for the BRNS Tornado Simulator, but this time, I engaged in more refined work involving 2D and 3D simulations of vertical axis turbines. Additionally, I developed a MATLAB code to perform hand calculations of the torque generated by the turbine, further enhancing my analytical skills.

As I continue my journey, I am driven by an unwavering commitment to excellence, a thirst for knowledge, and an eagerness to make meaningful contributions to the world of mechanical engineering and robotics. My experiences have taught me the importance of pushing my boundaries, embracing challenges, and constantly seeking new opportunities to grow and excel.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I am excited to share my journey and projects on GitHub, where I hope to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on innovative ideas, and make a positive impact on the world around me.
